# Statify

Statify is a web application for statistic viewing.

There are a few reasons why I created this website.

First of all, this website was created to help find accurate economic statistics for countries around the globe.

Because of my major, I often work with statistics, and there are no good websites for statistics viewing. So I decided to create my own. That is the main reason.

The secondary reason is web development studying.

To create this app I used TypeScript, NextJs, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind, and Chart.Js.
