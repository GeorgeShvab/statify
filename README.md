# Statify

Statify is a web application for statistic searching.

There are a few reasons why I created this website.
I am a student at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, and my major is human geography. Because of my major, I often work with statistics, and there are no good websites for statistics viewing. So I decided to create my own. That is the main reason.

Obviously, the secondary reason is web development studying.

To create this app I used TypeScript, NextJs, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind and Chart.Js.
