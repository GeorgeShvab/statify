# Statify

Statify is a web application designed for viewing and analyzing statistics.

#### Why I Created Statify
There are a few key reasons behind the creation of this website. The primary motivation was to provide a reliable resource for accessing accurate economic statistics for countries around the world. As someone who frequently works with statistics due to my major, I found existing websites lacking in quality and usability.

A secondary reason for developing Statify was to enhance my web development skills. Building this application allowed me to gain practical experience with several technologies.

#### Technologies Used
To create Statify, I used a range of technologies including TypeScript, Next.js, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js and so on.
